# Programming vacancies compare

The application is designed to evaluate available vacancies for programmers in the context of programming languages.

### How to install

Python 3 should already be installed.

It is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to isolate the project.
Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need the ```Secret key``` API-service [SuperJob](https://api.superjob.ru/). Put it in the environment variable SUPERJOB_SECRET_KEY.


### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
